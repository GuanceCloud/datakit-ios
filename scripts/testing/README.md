# Focused View Timing Metric Tests

The hostless XCTest project links the checkout's SwiftPM `GuanceSDK` product. It avoids demo app extensions and third-party test dependencies.

Prerequisites: Xcode, an available iOS simulator, and Ruby with `xcodeproj`.

```sh
ruby scripts/testing/view-timing-metrics-project.rb /tmp/FTViewTimingMetrics
xcodebuild -project /tmp/FTViewTimingMetrics/FTViewTimingMetrics.xcodeproj \
  -scheme FTViewTimingMetrics \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/ft-view-metrics-focused test
```

The same test file is registered in the existing iOS/tvOS unit-test targets. Tests inject exact event timestamps, replaceable internal INV/TNS predicates, collector clocks and queues. They cover actual writer filtering and serialization in addition to numeric lifecycle results. No external endpoint or sleep is required. The suite covers shared Resource/TNS intervals, completed batches, optional URL reclassification, View-origin changes, pure metric reads and full View replacement snapshots.
